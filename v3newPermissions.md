## Why this annoying notice? ##

**When YTRP auto-updates next time, you will have to go into the menu of Google Chrome and accept new permissions.** The last time an update required new permissions, some users reacted with one star ratings because I didn't explain why I needed the new permissions. I just love coding and always try to make users happy, so here it is the explanation of why the future version 3.1 will require new permissions.

## Why do you need those permissions? ##

The message shown by Google Chrome for the new requested permissions are very far from the real needs of the extension, but they are technically required for the following reasons:

  * **Access your data on all websites:** this is required for showing the related videos' rating bars inside the player when the video ends in the case of embedded videos. It's also needed to show rating bars for video results of Google searches, which was suggested by some users.

  * **Access your tabs and browsing activity:** this permission is not new, and it is required to show the configuration icon over the address bar when a tab enters in youtube.com. You can still hide the icon if you want.
